# Google-Play-App-Analysis

Mobile apps are now an essential part of everday life. Their ubiquitos use and ease of creation makes this an exceptionally lucrative market. With this in mind we will conduct a comprehensive analysis of the Google PLay android app market comparing over ten thousand plus apps. The goal here is to uncover insights in the data to devise strategies to drive growth and retention.

We will consider two datasets scraped from the Google Play website:

apps.csv: Contains details on 13 features across all applications on Google Play.

user_reviews.csv: Contains 100 reviews for each application, most helpful first. The text of each review has been pre-processed and given attributes across three features: Sentiment (Positive, Negative or Neutral), Sentiment Polarity and Sentiment Subjectivity.

This project will analyse apps across a number of attributes such as Categories, Ratings, File Sizes and Price.
Combining these attributes with user feedback enables us to identify applications that gain the most traction with users.
